# Partial email finder

## ⚠ I am not responsible for your use of this script ⚠

## Context
I wrote this script to find a full email from a partial email that can be found with the "Forgot password" tool in [Instagram][I] and [Twitter][T] using an username.

[T]:https://twitter.com/account/begin_password_reset
[I]:https://www.instagram.com/accounts/password/reset/

I used combolist search to find a full mail. This can be useful for doxing, recon, and hack (SI, BruteForce, etc...).

## Setup 

`git clone https://github.com/nicolasmf/Partial-Email-Finder`

`cd PartialEmailFinder`

`chmod +x emailFinder.py`

`./emailFinder.py`

## TODO

[ ] Add UI
[ ] Clean the code
[ ] Add comments
[ ] Better file search
